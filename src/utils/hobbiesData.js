This brought me to programming, and since then I have continued to learn about the wide variety of different technologies related to programming- starting with web development. I have a big interest in AI and I have tried out the Dall-E text-to-image AI creator, here is just a showcase of some of the ones that I made. I am eager to learn more as I further my career.",
