      "I wanted to create a portfolio that stood out a little bit more than the rest. In my bootcamp we had to make portfolios, so I was lucky enough to have the chance to view other people in classes. But they really all felt kind of the same, following a specific template we were given. I decided to branch away and do my own sort of thing. I really enjoy learning new Javascript and React technologies, so creating a portfolio that shows off my curiosity I figured would be a smart decision. That's why I have tried to implement some more graphic design/3d modeling with ThreeJS.",

      "!!I am currently building this and it will take a while because it's very large application!!- My friend and I are trying to start a business where users will be able to sign up their car and drive people to events while being paid per hour. This would be for people who are looking for fancier cars to be taken to formals, weddings etc or wanting a bigger vehicle for a larger crowded event. This application is currently in development and is a great learning step for myself by using popular technologies- such as Typescript, React, GraphQL and PostgreSQL. I am enjoying the experience so far and will be working on this for a few months while I continue to work on smaller solo projects.",

The users will also be able to see if the books are in stock, leave reviews for others and put them on hold. This app will also use JWT for the user to be authenticated when logging in. The use of a relational database will be needed due to the relationships of books, customers and review comments.",
